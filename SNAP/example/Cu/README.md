## SNAP potential for Cu

This directory contains the SNAP force field parameters for Cu. This potential is fitted from the DFT data, including bulk structures with elastic deformation, surfaces and DFT calculated molecular dynamics trajectories. 

The hyperparameter tuning and fitting procedures are described in detail in our publication [1] and thus are excluded from the repo.
